# ChaoCipher
### Low-Tech Encryption Scheme Pt.II

## Description

The Chaocipher was invented by J.F.Byrne in 1918 and, although simple by modern cryptographic standards, does not appear to have been broken until the algorithm was finally disclosed by his family in 2010.  

The algorithm is described in this paper by M.Rubin in 2010 and there is a C# implementation [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/b942f9/implementing-the-chaocipher-in-C-Sharp/).  

Chaocipher is a method of encryption invented by John F. Byrne in 1918, who tried unsuccessfully to interest the US Signal Corp and Navy in his system. In 1953, Byrne presented Chaocipher-encrypted messages as a challenge in his autobiography Silent Years. Although numerous students of cryptanalysis attempted to solve the challenge messages over the years, none succeeded. For 90 years, the Chaocipher algorithm was a closely guarded secret known only to a handful of persons. Following fruitful negotiations with the Byrne family during the period 2009â€“2010, the Chaocipher papers and materials have been donated to the National Cryptologic Museum in Ft. Meade, MD. This paper presents a comprehensive historical and technical evaluation of John F. Byrne and his Chaocipher system.
